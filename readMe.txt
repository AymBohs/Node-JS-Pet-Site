After the site sends you to a different page when you login successfully or receive a similar message, all you have to do is press the "Back" arrow that is built in the browser you are running it on.

As the sole developer behind the "Adopt A Dog/Cat Website," I used Node.js to create a seamless platform for connecting potential pet owners with adoptable dogs and cats. Node.js serves as the backbone of the site, ensuring consistent functionality and performance across all pages.

Within this framework, I established a unified template that includes a dynamic header displaying the adoption service name, a logo or picture, and real-time date and time. Users can easily navigate back to the home page by clicking on the logo. The footer, present on every page, features essential links, including a Privacy/Disclaimer Statement that reassures users about the security of their information.

Additionally, the system manages critical text files on the server: a login file (containing usernames and passwords) and an available pet information file (storing details about registered pets). New users can create accounts with unique usernames and secure passwords. While the "Have a pet to give away" section requires user login (specific behavior details pending), my project streamlines the pet adoption process and enhances user interaction with the site.
